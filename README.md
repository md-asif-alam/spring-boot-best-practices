## ðŸ”‘ What is Basic Authentication?

Basic Authentication is an HTTP authentication scheme that encodes a username and password using Base64 and sends it in the `Authorization` header of each request.
While simple, itâ€™s not considered secure on its ownâ€”credentials can be easily decoded if not used over **HTTPS**.
